Linux has long been considered an \"unofficial\" gaming platform; the support and target audience provided to it is not
a primary priority for most gaming organizations. Changes to this situation have accelerated, starting from 2021 onward,
as big players like [Valve](Wikipedia:Valve_Corporation "wikilink"), the [CodeWeavers](Wikipedia:CodeWeavers "wikilink")
group and the [community](Wikipedia:Open-source_software_development "wikilink") have made tremendous improvements to
the ecosystem, allowing Linux to truly become a viable platform for gaming. Further, more and more indie development
teams strive to use cross-platform rendering engines in order to have their game able to compile and run on Linux.

When it comes to gaming, the majority of user\'s thoughts are often directed towards popular [AAA
games](Wikipedia:AAA_games "wikilink") which are usually written exclusively for the [Microsoft
Windows](Wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") platform. This is understandable, however, it is not the only and sole
availability. Refer to [#Game environments](#Game_environments "wikilink") and [#Getting
games](#Getting_games "wikilink") further down the page where you can find software to run games from other platforms.

If you however are fixated on getting games written for [Microsoft Windows](Wikipedia:Microsoft_Windows "wikilink") to
work on Linux, then a different mindset, tools and approach is required; understanding internals and providing
functional substitution. See [#Game technicality](#Game_technicality "wikilink") below.

## Game technicality {#game_technicality}

There are ultimately *three complications* that arise from attempting to play [AAA
games](Wikipedia:AAA_games "wikilink") made for Windows on Linux. They are:

Graphics SDK:
:   Games written and compiled for an API that Linux does not recognize (such as
    [DirectX](Wikipedia:DirectX "wikilink")).

General library dependencies:
:   Libraries necessary for doing general purpose operations during gameplay, such as saving in-game, loading
    configuration files (e.g Microsoft Visual C++, MFC, .NET)

Incompatible interfaces:
:   Aside from the frameworks mentioned above, there is a further problem with binary formats and compiled code
    generated by Windows which Linux does not recognize.

Graphics SDK forward graphical calls to the underlying graphics driver which then proceeds to talk to the GPU hardware.

A huge amount of games use [DirectX](Wikipedia:DirectX "wikilink") as their main driving SDK. Linux, natively supports
only [OpenGL](Wikipedia:OpenGL "wikilink") and [Vulkan](Wikipedia:Vulkan_(API) "wikilink"). Linux by itself does not
support [DirectX](Wikipedia:DirectX "wikilink") or any of the aforementioned technologies (Visual C++, MFC, .NET).

Instead, several opensource equivalents have been written which attempt to provide **identical** functionality,
ultimately achieving the same result from a graphics point of view. These equivalents have their \"own\" written
substitutes which attempt to \"re-invent\" what the original SDK calls would possibly achieve from a [black
box](Wikipedia:black_box "wikilink") point of view. Popular ones include:

-   [Wine](Wine "wikilink") (Wine Is Not an Emulator) \[provides a \"loader vm\", self written dependencies, interop and
    more\]
-   [Proton](Proton "wikilink") (forked Wine project, optimized for Steam by Valve)
-   [Mono](Wikipedia:Mono_(software) "wikilink") (.NET alternative)
-   [MF-Media](Wikipedia:Media_Foundation "wikilink") (media foundation dependencies)

For example, a call to load, transform and shade vertices on [DirectX](Wikipedia:DirectX "wikilink") may be re-written
from scratch in a new *.dll*/*.so* owned by Wine, providing their own \"hypothetical\" belief on what the function may
be doing underneath, and forward it instead to an [OpenGL](Wikipedia:OpenGL "wikilink") alternative, effectively trying
to achieve similar results. Since these calls are direct equivalents and treated \"as if\" DirectX was running,
performance is not impacted. (with the exception of the starting overhead to interop with these)

These tools are often brought in the distribution together on the system at the same time. A **prefix** (Wine\'s
terminology for a directory mimicking a Windows sandbox) is created and configured. Dependencies are installed **inside
the prefix** (the \"sandbox\" still needs the game\'s [redistributables](Wikipedia:Library_(computing) "wikilink")),
often with [winetricks](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Winetricks), followed by an attempt to run the game
\"as if\" it was executed from Windows.

This, nowadays, fortunately works for most games (aside from [anti-cheat protected
ones](https://www.keengamer.com/articles/features/opinion-pieces/kernel-level-anti-cheat-and-7-games-or-programs-that-use-it/),
which require a kernel driver that Wine/Proton does not yet have). If a game does not work, it is usually as a result of
incompatible packages, missing dependencies or unimplemented functionality by Wine/Proton.

Lutris is a piece of software that provides runners and sandboxes that handle dependencies for you when you install
games, if the above process is found tedious and/or complicated.

## Common game dependencies {#common_game_dependencies}

In order to gain a more in-depth understanding of what you will intend to do if you decide to go the Wine/Proton route,
it is worthwhile to cover the common dependencies that games require in order to execute. Architecture also needs to be
considered in mind, whether x86 or x64, preferably both.

A prefix would need to have the following populated into it in order to run **most** Windows games.

### Mandatory (for high coverage) {#mandatory_for_high_coverage}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Style|Links to wiki articles that contain package links (e.g. [[Fonts]]) should be used here}}
```
-   [Microsoft Core Fonts](Microsoft_fonts "wikilink")
-   Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 (2022 has the most coverage, recommended) \[2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017-2018,
    2019, 2022\]
-   DirectX 9.0 (11.0 has the most coverage, recommended) \[June SDK update 2010\] {which consists of, to name a few:}
    -   Direct3D
    -   Direct2D
    -   DirectShow
    -   DirectInput
    -   DirectPlay
    -   DirectSound
    -   DXGI
    -   XAudio2
-   .NET Framework (4.8 has most coverage)
-   [OpenGL](OpenGL "wikilink")
-   OpenCL
-   [Vulkan](Vulkan "wikilink")

### Optional (but still common) {#optional_but_still_common}

-   XNA
-   PhysX
-   Quicktime
-   Adobe Reader 11
-   [Java](Java "wikilink") SRE (e.g for [Minecraft](Minecraft "wikilink"))

### Rare (less common) {#rare_less_common}

-   Gamespy
-   MIDI driver
-   ACDSee

## Machine requirements {#machine_requirements}

It is not enough to just populate a prefix with the dependencies the game will need. The kernel itself has to have the
substitution it will provide to the calls the game will make. As already mentioned, drivers and alternatives are
available.

### Drivers

-   AMD drivers: see [AMDGPU](AMDGPU "wikilink").
-   Intel drivers: see [Intel graphics](Intel_graphics "wikilink").
-   NVIDIA drivers: see [NVIDIA](NVIDIA "wikilink").

### Dependency for the machine & substitutes {#dependency_for_the_machine_substitutes}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Note|This is mostly informative. Some of these packages install themselves once you install the major ones.}}
```
-   [Wine](Wine "wikilink")

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{Pkg|wine-gecko}}
    ```

-   ```{=mediawiki}
    {{Pkg|wine-mono}}
    ```

-   [Vulkan](Vulkan "wikilink")

-   [OpenGL](OpenGL "wikilink")

-   [Proton](Proton "wikilink") Redistributables (optional, but it may help)

## Game environments {#game_environments}

Wine/Proton are not the only approaches to play games. Different environments exist to play games in Linux, and have
just as many (or more) games than on Windows:

-   Native -- games which have builds targeting the Linux platform, shipping with OpenGL and/or Vulkan graphics API
    support.
-   [Emulators](Wikipedia:Emulator "wikilink") -- required for running software designed for other architectures and
    systems. Most games run out of the box once the ROM is fed in to the emulator and issues are rarely encountered. For
    options, see [Video game platform emulators](Video_game_platform_emulators "wikilink").
-   [Java](Java "wikilink") - write once, run everywhere platform. Examples of popular games that run on Linux are
    [Minecraft](Minecraft "wikilink"), [Runescape](RuneScape "wikilink"), [Wurm
    Online](Wikipedia:Wurm_Online "wikilink"), [Puzzle Pirates](Wikipedia:Puzzle_Pirates "wikilink").
-   Web -- games running in a web browser.
    -   HTML5 games use canvas and WebGL technologies and work in all modern browsers.
    -   [Flash](Flash "wikilink")-based -- you need to install an extension to play.
-   [Wine](Wine "wikilink") -- Windows compatibility layer, allows to run Windows applications (and a lot of games) on
    Unix-like operating systems. Supports DirectX to Vulkan translation in runtime with the addition of
    [Wine#DXVK](Wine#DXVK "wikilink"), which improves performance in games which only support DirectX.
-   [Virtual machines](Virtual_machine "wikilink") -- can be used to install compatible operating systems (such as
    Windows). [VirtualBox](VirtualBox "wikilink") has good 3D support. As an extension of this, if you have compatible
    hardware you can consider VGA passthrough to a Windows KVM guest, keyword is [\"virtual function I/O\"
    (VFIO)](https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/vfio.html), or [PCI passthrough via
    OVMF](PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF "wikilink").
-   [Proton/DXVK](https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561) -- Fork of Wine
    designed for use in the proprietary `{{Pkg|steam}}`{=mediawiki} platform, enabling better support for games than
    Wine. See [Steam#Proton Steam-Play](Steam#Proton_Steam-Play "wikilink") for more information.

## Game compatibility {#game_compatibility}

### Increase vm.max_map_count {#increase_vm.max_map_count}

Having the `{{ic|vm.max_map_count}}`{=mediawiki} set to a low value can affect the stability and performance of some
games. It can therefore be desirable to increase the size permanently by creating the following
[sysctl](sysctl "wikilink") config file.

```{=mediawiki}
{{hc|/etc/sysctl.d/80-gamecompatibility.conf|2=
vm.max_map_count = 2147483642
}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{Note|The default value is set by {{ic|/usr/lib/sysctl.d/10-arch.conf}}, if you use a different file make sure it has higher priority. See {{man|8|sysctl|SYSTEM FILE PRECEDENCE}}.}}
```
Arch Linux uses the value **1048576** by default
[1](https://archlinux.org/news/increasing-the-default-vmmax_map_count-value/), which Fedora considers a safe value
[2](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-39-Max-Map-Count-Approve). This default value is likely to be sufficient for
current games, as increasing the value was mostly important when Arch used the kernel default of 65530
[3](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-39-VM-Max-Map-Count). A value of **2147483642** (MAX_INT - 5) is the default in
SteamOS.

Apply the changes without reboot by running:

`# sysctl --system`

```{=mediawiki}
{{Note|This can lead to incompatibility with older programs trying to read core dump files [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.18/include/linux/mm.h#L178].}}
```
## Getting games {#getting_games}

Just because games are available for Linux does not mean that they are native; they might be pre-packaged with
[Wine](Wine "wikilink") or [DOSBox](DOSBox "wikilink").

[AUR](AUR "wikilink") see [List of games](List_of_games "wikilink").

## Configuring games {#configuring_games}

Certain games or game types may need special configuration to run or to run as expected. For the most part, games will
work right out of the box in Arch Linux with possibly better performance than on other distributions due to compile time
optimizations. However, some special setups may require a bit of configuration or scripting to make games run as
smoothly as desired.

### Multi-screen setups {#multi_screen_setups}

Running a multi-screen setup may lead to problems with full-screen games. In such a case, [running a second X
server](#Starting_games_in_a_separate_X_server "wikilink") is one possible solution. For NVIDIA users, a solution may be
found in [NVIDIA#Gaming using TwinView](NVIDIA#Gaming_using_TwinView "wikilink").

### Keyboard grabbing {#keyboard_grabbing}

Many games grab the keyboard, noticeably preventing you from switching windows (also known as alt-tabbing).

Some SDL games (e.g. Guacamelee) let you disable grabbing by pressing `{{ic|Ctrl-g}}`{=mediawiki}.

```{=mediawiki}
{{Note|SDL is known to sometimes not be able to grab the input system. In such a case, it may succeed in grabbing it after a few seconds of waiting.}}
```
### Starting games in a separate X server {#starting_games_in_a_separate_x_server}

In some cases like those mentioned above, it may be necessary or desired to run a second X server. Running a second X
server has multiple advantages such as better performance, the ability to \"tab\" out of your game by using
`{{ic|Ctrl+Alt+F7}}`{=mediawiki}/`{{ic|Ctrl+Alt+F8}}`{=mediawiki}, no crashing your primary X session (which may have
open work on) in case a game conflicts with the graphics driver. The new X server will be akin a remote access login for
the ALSA, so your user need to be part of the `{{ic|audio}}`{=mediawiki} group to be able to hear any sound.

To start a second X server (using the free first person shooter game [Xonotic](https://www.xonotic.org/) as an example)
you can simply do:

`$ xinit /usr/bin/xonotic-glx -- :1 vt$XDG_VTNR`

This can further be spiced up by using a separate X configuration file:

`$ xinit /usr/bin/xonotic-glx -- :1 -xf86config xorg-game.conf vt$XDG_VTNR`

A good reason to provide an alternative *xorg.conf* here may be that your primary configuration makes use of NVIDIA\'s
Twinview which would render your 3D games like Xonotic in the middle of your multiscreen setup, spanned across all
screens. This is undesirable, thus starting a second X with an alternative configuration where the second screen is
disabled is advised.

```{=mediawiki}
{{Note|The X configuration file location is relative to the {{ic|/etc/X11}} directory.}}
```
A game starting script making use of Openbox for your home directory or `{{ic|/usr/local/bin}}`{=mediawiki} may look
like this:

```{=mediawiki}
{{hc|~/game.sh|<nowiki>
if [ $# -ge 1 ]; then
        game="$(which $1)"
        openbox="$(which openbox)"
        tmpgame="/tmp/tmpgame.sh"
        DISPLAY=:1.0
        echo -e "${openbox} &\n${game}" > ${tmpgame}
        echo "starting ${game}"
        xinit ${tmpgame} -- :1 -xf86config xorg-game.conf || exit 1
else
        echo "not a valid argument"
fi
</nowiki>}}
```
After making it [executable](executable "wikilink") you would be able to do:

`$ ~/game.sh xonotic-glx`

```{=mediawiki}
{{Note|If you want to avoid loading configs from {{ic|/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d}}, you should also use the {{ic|-configdir}} option, pointing to an empty directory.}}
```
### Adjusting mouse detections {#adjusting_mouse_detections}

For games that require exceptional amount of mouse skill (like shooters), adjusting the [mouse polling
rate](mouse_polling_rate "wikilink") can help improve accuracy on high-end mice. The improvement can be by a few
milliseconds when increasing from typical polling rates like 250 Hz - 500 Hz to 1000 Hz, but increasing past 1000 Hz
will get at most slightly less than a millisecond of improvement. In general, latency is influenced by the quality of
the mouse\'s microcontroller, firmware, and sensor, and [the mice with the lowest latency currently available don\'t
necessarily improve past 1000 Hz](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/endgame-gear-op1-8k/5.html).

### Binaural audio with OpenAL {#binaural_audio_with_openal}

For games using [OpenAL](Wikipedia:OpenAL "wikilink"), if you use headphones you may get much better positional audio
using OpenAL\'s [HRTF](Wikipedia:Head-related_transfer_function "wikilink") filters. To enable,
[create](create "wikilink"):

```{=mediawiki}
{{hc|~/.alsoftrc|2=
hrtf = true
}}
```
Alternatively, install `{{AUR|openal-hrtf}}`{=mediawiki} from the AUR, and edit the options in
`{{ic|/etc/openal/alsoftrc.conf}}`{=mediawiki}.

For Source games, the ingame setting \`dsp_slow_cpu\` must be set to \`1\` to enable HRTF, otherwise the game will
enable its own processing instead. You will also either need to set up Steam to use native runtime, or link its copy of
openal.so to your own local copy. For completeness, also use the following options:

`dsp_slow_cpu 1 # Disable in-game spatialiazation`\
`snd_spatialize_roundrobin 1 # Disable spatialization 1.0*100% of sounds`\
`dsp_enhance_stereo 0 # Disable DSP sound effects. You may want to leave this on, if you find it does not interfere with your perception of the sound effects.`\
`snd_pitchquality 1 # Use high quality sounds`

### Tuning PulseAudio {#tuning_pulseaudio}

If you are using [PulseAudio](PulseAudio "wikilink"), you may wish to tweak some default settings to make sure it is
running optimally.

#### Enabling realtime priority and negative nice level {#enabling_realtime_priority_and_negative_nice_level}

PulseAudio is built to be run with realtime priority, being an audio daemon. However, because of security risks of it
locking up the system, it is scheduled as a regular thread by default. To adjust this, first make sure you are in the
`{{ic|audio}}`{=mediawiki} group. Then, uncomment and edit the following lines in
`{{ic|/etc/pulse/daemon.conf}}`{=mediawiki}:

```{=mediawiki}
{{hc|/etc/pulse/daemon.conf|2=
high-priority = yes
nice-level = -11

realtime-scheduling = yes
realtime-priority = 5}}
```
and restart PulseAudio.

#### Using higher quality remixing for better sound {#using_higher_quality_remixing_for_better_sound}

PulseAudio on Arch uses speex-float-1 by default to remix channels, which is considered a \'medium-low\' quality
remixing. If your system can handle the extra load, you may benefit from setting it to one of the following instead:

`resample-method = speex-float-10`

#### Matching hardware buffers to Pulse\'s buffering {#matching_hardware_buffers_to_pulses_buffering}

Matching the buffers can reduce stuttering and increase performance marginally. See
[here](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=44862) for more details.

## Remote gaming {#remote_gaming}

[Cloud gaming](Wikipedia:Cloud_gaming "wikilink") has gained a lot of popularity in the last few years, because of low
client-side hardware requirements. The only important thing is stable internet connection (over the Ethernet cable or 5
GHz Wi-Fi recommended) with a minimum speed of 5--10 Mbit/s (depending on the video quality and framerate).

See [Gamepad#Gamepad over network](Gamepad#Gamepad_over_network "wikilink") for using a gamepad over a network with
services that do not normally support this.

```{=mediawiki}

## Improving performance {#improving_performance}

See also main article: [Improving performance](Improving_performance "wikilink"). For Wine programs, see
[Wine#Performance](Wine#Performance "wikilink"). For a good gaming experience low latency, a consistent response time
(no jitter) and enough throughput (frames per second) are needed. If you have multiple sources with a little jitter they
are likely to overlap sometimes and produce noticeable stutter. Therefore most of the time it is preferable to decrease
the throughput a little to gain more response time consistency. On the other hand if you get low average FPS or if the
gaming application itself produces spikes in CPU demand it is better to increase raw throughput.

### Improve clock_gettime throughput {#improve_clock_gettime_throughput}

User space programs and especially games do many calls to `{{man|2|clock_gettime}}`{=mediawiki} to get the current time
for calculating game physics, fps and so on. The time usage can be seen by running

`# perf top`

and looking at the overhead of read_hpet (or acpi_pm_read).

If you are not dependent on a very precise timer you can switch from hpet (high precision event timer) or acpi_pm (ACPI
Power Management Timer) to the faster TSC (time stamp counter) timer. Add the [kernel
parameters](kernel_parameters "wikilink")

`tsc=reliable clocksource=tsc`

to make TSC available and enable it. After that reboot and confirm the clocksource by running

`# cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource*/current_clocksource`

You can see all currently available timers by running

`# cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource*/available_clocksource`

and change between them by echoing one into current_clocksource. On a Zen 3 system benchmarking with
[4](https://gist.github.com/weirddan455/eb807fa48915652abeca3b6421970ab4) shows a \~50 times higher throughput of
`{{ic|tsc}}`{=mediawiki} compared to `{{ic|hpet}}`{=mediawiki} or `{{ic|acpi_pm}}`{=mediawiki}.

```{=mediawiki}
{{Warning|Forcing {{ic|tsc}} when it's unreliable will cause Firefox to crash randomly because it breaks the monotonicity of {{ic|clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)}}[https://mastodon.yuuta.moe/@coelacanthus/110996261222325004], on which Firefox relies. Use at your own risk!}}
```
### Tweaking kernel parameters for response time consistency {#tweaking_kernel_parameters_for_response_time_consistency}

You can install the realtime kernel to get some advantages by default (see [realtime kernel](realtime_kernel "wikilink")
article) but it costs CPU throughput and can delay interrupt handling. Additionally the realtime kernel is not
compatible with `{{Pkg|nvidia-open-dkms}}`{=mediawiki} and does not change the scheduler for SCHED_NORMAL (also named
SCHED_OTHER) processes, which is the default process scheduling type. The following kernel parameter changes improve the
response time consistency for the realtime kernel as well as other kernels such as the default linux kernel:

Proactive compaction for (Transparent) Hugepage allocation reduces the average but not necessarily the maximum
allocation stalls. Disable proactive compaction because it introduces jitter according to [kernel
documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html) ([inner
workings](https://nitingupta.dev/post/proactive-compaction/)):

`# echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/compaction_proactiveness`

Reduce the watermark boost factor to defragment only one pageblock (2MB on 64-bit x86) in case of memory fragmentation.
After a memory fragmentation event this helps to better keep the application data in the last level processor cache.

`# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/watermark_boost_factor`

If you have enough free RAM increase the number of minimum free Kilobytes to avoid stalls on memory allocations:
[5](https://highscalability.com/blog/2015/4/8/the-black-magic-of-systematically-reducing-linux-os-jitter.html)[6](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html).
Do not set this below 1024 KB or above 5% of your systems memory. Reserving 1GB:

`# echo 1048576 > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes`

If you have enough free RAM increase the watermark scale factor to further reduce the likelihood of allocation stalls
(explanations
[7](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/anticipating-your-memory-needs)[8](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/anticipating-your-memory-needs-2)).
Setting watermark distances to 5% of RAM:

`# echo 500 > /proc/sys/vm/watermark_scale_factor`

Avoid swapping (locking pages that introduces latency and uses disk IO) unless the system has no more free memory:

`# echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`

Make sure [zswap](zswap "wikilink") is enabled. If there arises the need for swapping pages, then zswap helps reduce
swapping related stutter. If you do not have a swap partition, you can [use zram](zram#Usage_as_swap "wikilink") instead
of zswap.

Enable Multi-Gen Least Recently Used (MGLRU) but reduce the likelihood of lock contention at a minor performance cost
[9](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/multigen_lru.html):

`# echo 5 > /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled`

Disable zone reclaim (locking and moving memory pages that introduces latency spikes):

`# echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode`

Disable Transparent Hugepages (THP) at a performance cost. Even if defragmentation is disabled, THPs might introduce
latency spikes
[10](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html)[11](https://rigtorp.se/virtual-memory/)[12](https://alexandrnikitin.github.io/blog/transparent-hugepages-measuring-the-performance-impact/).
Enable only when the application specifically requests it by using madvise and advise:

```{=mediawiki}
{{bc|
# echo madvise > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
# echo advise > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled
# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
}}
```
Note that if your game uses TCMalloc (e.g., Dota 2 and CS:GO) then it is not recommended to disable THP as it comes with
a large performance cost [13](https://github.com/google/tcmalloc/blob/master/docs/tuning.md#system-level-optimizations).

Reduce the maximum page lock acquisition latency while retaining adequate throughput
[14](https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-59-unfairness)[15](https://openbenchmarking.org/result/2009154-FI-LINUX58CO57&sro)[16](https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-59-fairness):

`# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/page_lock_unfairness`

Tweak the scheduler settings. The following scheduler settings are in conflict with `{{AUR|cfs-zen-tweaks}}`{=mediawiki}
so for each setting choose only one provider. By default the linux kernel scheduler is optimized for throughput and not
latency. The following hand-made settings change that and are tested with different games to be a noticeable
improvement. They might not be optimal for your use case; consider modifying them as necessary
[17](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/177953)[18](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/tuning/html/book-tuning/cha-tuning-taskscheduler.html):

```{=mediawiki}
{{bc|
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled
# echo 3000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us
# echo 3000000 > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/base_slice_ns
# echo 500000 > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/migration_cost_ns
# echo 8 > /sys/kernel/debug/sched/nr_migrate
}}
```
Further, it is recommended to test different schedulers as described in [Improving_performance#CPU
scheduler](Improving_performance#CPU_scheduler "wikilink"). For example, the
[scx_cosmos](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/tree/main/scheds/rust/scx_cosmos) scheduler from
`{{Pkg|scx-scheds}}`{=mediawiki} shows promise for improving response time consistency, as it optimizes task-to-CPU
locality (enhancing cache hit consistency between runs), reduces locking contention, and is suitable for general usage
scenarios, prioritizing interactive tasks under load. Similarly,
[scx_lavd](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/tree/main/scheds/rust/scx_lavd) is specifically optimized for consistent
gaming performance. You should test different schedulers to see which is the most successful for your workload.

#### Make the changes permanent {#make_the_changes_permanent}

Usually, the advice for permanently setting [kernel parameters](kernel_parameters "wikilink") is to configure create a
[sysctl](sysctl "wikilink") configuration file or change your [boot loader](boot_loader "wikilink") options. However,
since our change span both procfs (`{{ic|/proc}}`{=mediawiki}, containing sysctl) and sysfs (`{{ic|/sys}}`{=mediawiki}),
the most convenient way is to use [systemd-tmpfiles](systemd-tmpfiles "wikilink"):

```{=mediawiki}
{{hc|/etc/tmpfiles.d/consistent-response-time-for-gaming.conf|
#    Path                  Mode UID  GID  Age Argument
w /proc/sys/vm/compaction_proactiveness - - - - 0
w /proc/sys/vm/watermark_boost_factor - - - - 1
w /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes - - - - 1048576
w /proc/sys/vm/watermark_scale_factor - - - - 500
w /proc/sys/vm/swappiness - - - - 10
w /sys/kernel/mm/lru_gen/enabled - - - - 5
w /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode - - - - 0
w /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled - - - - madvise
w /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/shmem_enabled - - - - advise
w /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag - - - - never
w /proc/sys/vm/page_lock_unfairness - - - - 1
w /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first - - - - 0
w /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled - - - - 1
w /proc/sys/kernel/sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us - - - - 3000
w /sys/kernel/debug/sched/base_slice_ns  - - - - 3000000
w /sys/kernel/debug/sched/migration_cost_ns - - - - 500000
w /sys/kernel/debug/sched/nr_migrate - - - - 8
}}
```
After that reboot and see if the values applied correctly.

### Reduce buffer bloat {#reduce_buffer_bloat}

A device experiences buffer bloat when a large buffer queues requests, causing new requests to be blocked for a long
time. This can occur with both sending and receiving data.

Buffer bloat is solved by having a smart queuing algorithm that gives fair and timely share towards the device. Smart
queuing algorithms produce quicker and more consistent response times, but increase CPU overhead. For interactive
workloads reduced buffer bloat is desirable.

#### Reduce buffer bloat on storage devices {#reduce_buffer_bloat_on_storage_devices}

For storage devices, the BFQ scheduler is the most effective at minimizing buffer bloat and improving interactivity
[Improving performance#The scheduling algorithms](Improving_performance#The_scheduling_algorithms "wikilink").

#### Reduce buffer bloat on the network {#reduce_buffer_bloat_on_the_network}

You can use the default [fq_codel](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/) or the improved
[cake](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/codel/wiki/Cake/) smart queue management algorithms. They can be set via
[sysctl](sysctl "wikilink"). Your home internet router can cause buffer bloat, which might be mitigated by reconfiguring
it, installing a new router OS, or replacing the router ([more
info](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/What_can_I_do_about_Bufferbloat/)).

[Here](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/Tests_for_Bufferbloat/) are some easy ways to test for network
buffer bloat.

### Improve PCI Express Latencies {#improve_pci_express_latencies}

Change the PCI Express Latencies similar to CachyOS
[19](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/pci-latency). Reduce the maximum cycles a PCI-E
Client can occupy the bus, except for sound cards [20](https://maximum-tech.net/what-is-pci-latency-timer/). Note that
these settings are in conflict with [Professional audio#Optimizing system
configuration](Professional_audio#Optimizing_system_configuration "wikilink").

```{=mediawiki}
{{bc|
# setpci -v -s '*:*' latency_timer{{=}}
```
20

1.  setpci -v -s \'0:0\' latency_timer{{=}}0
2.  setpci -v -d \"\*:\*:04xx\" latency_timer{{=}}80

}}

To enable these settings consistently run them as super user on [system boot](Autostarting "wikilink").

### Disabling simultaneous multithreading (SMT) {#disabling_simultaneous_multithreading_smt}

Whether or not disabling SMT improves your gaming experience depends on your hardware and gaming applications.

Advantages of SMT:

1.  Higher total throughput if your application can make use of the additional threads
2.  More run-queues for the scheduler and therefore on average less waiting time for a process thread to get scheduled
    on a core

Advantages of disabling SMT:

1.  Higher single core performance due to not needing to share core internal resources and the ability of the kernel and
    firmware to disable SMT related security mitigations
2.  More consistent single core performance. Depending on your processors microarchitecture, SMT shares various
    processor internal resources like instruction decoding units, micro-operations cache, register renaming
    capabilities, L1-, L2-Cache and translation lookaside buffer entries. Depending on what a sibling thread does, the
    throughput of a main thread varies. SMT also lessens the fairness of the process scheduler even if it is aware of
    SMT.

If you disable SMT, do so in the BIOS/UEFI to improve single-core performance. (Example of SMT sharing CPU internal
resources:
[21](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-business-docs/white-papers/amd-epyc-smt-technology-brief.pdf))

### Load shared objects immediately for better first time latency {#load_shared_objects_immediately_for_better_first_time_latency}

Set the [environment variable](environment_variable "wikilink")

`LD_BIND_NOW=1`

for your games, to avoid needing to load program code at run time (see `{{man|8|ld.so}}`{=mediawiki}), leading to a
delay the first time a function is called. Do not set this for *startplasma-x11* or other programs that link in
libraries that do not actually exist on the system anymore and are never called by the program. If this is the case, the
program fails on startup trying to link a nonexistent shared object, making this issue easily identifiable. Most games
should start fine with this setting enabled. Since packages inside the official repository are built with RELRO
[22](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro) by default, only packages
from other sources should be affected in terms of first time latency, bugs in linking might still be triggered.

### Utilities

#### GameMode

[GameMode](GameMode "wikilink") is daemon and library combo that allows games to request a set of optimisations be
temporarily applied to the host OS. This can improve game performance.

#### Gamescope

[Gamescope](Gamescope "wikilink") is a microcompositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck. Its goal is to provide
an isolated compositor that is tailored towards gaming and supports many gaming-centric features.

### Reducing DRI latency {#reducing_dri_latency}

Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) Configuration Files apply for all DRI drivers including Mesa and Nouveau. You can
change the DRI configuration systemwide in `{{ic|/etc/drirc}}`{=mediawiki} or per user in
`{{ic|$HOME/.drirc}}`{=mediawiki}. If they do not exist, you have to create them first. Both files use the same syntax;
documentation for these options can be found at <https://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/ConfigurationOptions/>. To reduce
input latency by disabling synchronization to vblank, add the following:

`<driconf>`{=html}\
`   ``<device>`{=html}\
`       ``<application name="Default">`{=html}\
`           ``<option name="vblank_mode" value="0" />`{=html}\
`       ``</application>`{=html}\
`   ``</device>`{=html}\
`</driconf>`{=html}

### Improving frame rates and responsiveness with scheduling policies {#improving_frame_rates_and_responsiveness_with_scheduling_policies}

Most games can benefit if given the correct scheduling policies for the kernel to prioritize the task. These policies
should ideally be set per-thread by the application itself.

For programs which do not implement scheduling policies on their own, application known as
`{{Pkg|schedtool}}`{=mediawiki}, and its associated daemon `{{AUR|schedtoold}}`{=mediawiki} can handle many of these
tasks automatically.

To edit what programs relieve what policies, simply edit `{{ic|/etc/schedtoold.conf}}`{=mediawiki} and add the program
followed by the *schedtool* arguments desired.

#### Policies

```{=mediawiki}
{{ic|SCHED_ISO}}
```
(only implemented in BFS/MuQSSPDS schedulers found in -pf and -ck [kernels](kernel "wikilink")) -- will not only allow
the process to use a maximum of 80 percent of the CPU, but will attempt to reduce latency and stuttering wherever
possible. Most if not all games will benefit from this:

`bit.trip.runner -I`

```{=mediawiki}
{{ic|SCHED_FIFO}}
```
provides an alternative, that can even work better. You should test to see if your applications run more smoothly with
`{{ic|SCHED_FIFO}}`{=mediawiki}, in which case by all means use it instead. Be warned though, as
`{{ic|SCHED_FIFO}}`{=mediawiki} runs the risk of starving the system! Use this in cases where -I is used below:

`bit.trip.runner -F -p 15`

#### Nice levels {#nice_levels}

Secondly, the nice level sets which tasks are processed first, in ascending order. A nice level of -4 is recommended for
most multimedia tasks, including games:

`bit.trip.runner -n -4`

#### Core affinity {#core_affinity}

There is some confusion in development as to whether the driver should be multithreading, or the program. Allowing both
the driver and program to simultaneously multithread can result in significant performance reductions, such as framerate
loss and increased risk of crashes. Examples of this include a number of modern games, and any Wine program which is
running with [GLSL](Wikipedia:OpenGL_Shading_Language "wikilink") enabled. To select a single core and allow only the
driver to handle this process, simply use the `{{ic|-a 0x''#''}}`{=mediawiki} flag, where *\#* is the core number, e.g.:

`bit.trip.runner -a 0x1`

uses first core.

Some CPUs are hyperthreaded and have only 2 or 4 cores but show up as 4 or 8, and are best accounted for:

`bit.trip.runner -a 0x5`

which use virtual cores 0101, or 1 and 3.

#### General case {#general_case}

For most games which require high framerates and low latency, usage of all of these flags seems to work best. Affinity
should be checked per-program, however, as most native games can understand the correct usage. For a general case:

`bit.trip.runner -I -n -4`\
`Amnesia.bin64 -I -n -4`\
`hl2.exe -I -n -4 -a 0x1 #Wine with GLSL enabled`

etc.

#### Optimus, and other helping programs {#optimus_and_other_helping_programs}

As a general rule, any other process which the game requires to operate should be reniced to a level above that of the
game itself. Strangely, Wine has a problem known as *reverse scheduling*, it can often have benefits when the more
important processes are set to a higher nice level. Wineserver also seems unconditionally to benefit from
`{{ic|SCHED_FIFO}}`{=mediawiki}, since it rarely consumes the whole CPU and needs higher prioritization when possible.

`optirun -I -n -5`\
`wineserver -F -p 20 -n 19`\
`steam.exe -I -n -5`

## Peripherals

### Mouse

You might want to set your [mouse acceleration](mouse_acceleration "wikilink") to control your mouse more accurately.

If your mouse has more than 3 buttons, you might want to see [Mouse buttons](Mouse_buttons "wikilink").

If you are using a gaming mouse (especially Logitech and Steelseries) you may want to configure your mouse [polling
rate](mouse_polling_rate "wikilink"), DPI, LEDs etc. using `{{Pkg|piper}}`{=mediawiki}. See [this
page](https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/tree/master/data/devices) for a full list of supported devices by piper.
Alternatively `{{Pkg|solaar}}`{=mediawiki} for logitech devices.

### LEDs

You can change and manipulate various RGBs with `{{Pkg|openrgb}}`{=mediawiki}, for a list of currently supported devices
see [23](https://openrgb.org/devices_0.9.html)
